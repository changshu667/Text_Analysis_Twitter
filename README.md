# Text_Analysis_Twitter

## Project Type: course Project
## Problem
This project aims to analyze the landscape of racist hate speech against different race groups on Twitter. In recent years, with the political climate in the US become more divisive, many viewpoints which may have seems to be in the country's rearview mirror have been brought back to the forefront of collective consciousness. With the advent of social media, the average American has a greater ability to state their beliefs openly. As such, hate speech and racism are more openly discussed and have become a centerpiece in not only political discussion but peopleâ€™s daily life.

## Approach
First, to collect the racist tweets, I utilized web scrapping and pulled a database of racial slurs from RSDB.com. And then I conducted a dictionary-based search of Tweets based on those words. From those tweets, I manually curated Tweets to make sure explicit racist words are being used. Next, I calculated a toxicity score for each explicit racist tweet. Based on this, I analyzed the toxicity extent and landscape of racist tweets against different race groups using topic modeling and text networks.
